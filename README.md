Hello, I am Ron.  First and foremost I am a husband and father, my greatest achievement.  From a professional standpoint, I like to consider myself an expert generalist with technology.  I know a lot about a lot.  I have blessed in my career that I have worked for some really good people in my journey, and even had the opportunity to run my own business and help start up a couple of businesses.

# Background

As I mentioned I helped start 2 companies.  I have worked for 3 different hosting companies, working on the phones for 2 of them and being a Sr .NET developer for one of them.  While working at one of them I managed to move up off the phones.  I had access to over 700 Linux servers and over 200 Windows servers.  I helped manage professional services, the office of the president emails, I wrote a script that would fix an issue with PHP applications to help them migrate from MySQL 4.x to 5.x, and among other things a low-end sysadmin.  I was the person that they would say this customer needs this done, and I would find a way to do it.  It was a fun job I got to dabble in a lot of things.  I got to be the SR/Lead developer for a local web development company.  One of the best opportunities is when I got on as a .NET Developer for a digital consultancy (Nerdery).  I started as a developer worked hard and did a pivot.  I transitioned to the cloud and start a new path.  I look forward to seeing where I go from here.
